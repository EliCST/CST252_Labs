    <p class="P0">A fun educational game that explores the many sides that are in shapes. The shape on screen is clickable and tells the player how many sides are in a shape. Once the shape is clicked, another side is added until the player hits a dodecahedron is formed.</p>

        Sides in a Shape (working title) is an interactive game designed to educate people the different 
        types of shapes with the sides they have in them. </p>
    <img id="pictures" src="images/image1.jpeg" alt="">  <p class="p2">As the player places the mouse cursor over a shape, a text window will appear next to the shape, 
        telling the player the name of the shape as well as how many sides are in it. </p>
    <img id="pictures" src="images/image2.jpeg" alt=""> <p class="p3">The interactivity of this game comes from clicking on the shape. 
        As the player uses the mouse to click on a shape, it gains another side.
         For example, once the clicks on a triangle, another side forms and it becomes a square.
          Clicking on the square adds another side, the result being the square becomes a pentagon.
           And so on and so forth. </p>
